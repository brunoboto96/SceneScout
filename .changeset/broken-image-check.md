Snapshots now list images that failed to load, under `BROKEN IMAGES`, read from the DOM. This catches an image whose URL answers 200 with something that is not an image, which the HTTP oracle cannot see because no request failed. Images that occupy no space (inside a closed panel, tracking pixels) are not reported.

An `<img>` is now named by its alt text and listed with the role `image`; it previously appeared as `generic "(unnamed)"`. For the uncommon `<img>` that is collected without a `data-testid` (one with `onclick` or an explicit role), this changes its element key, so states containing it are seen as new once.
