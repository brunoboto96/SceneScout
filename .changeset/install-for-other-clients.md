"scenescout": minor

`scenescout install --client <list>` registers the server with clients other than Claude Code: `cursor`, `vscode`, `codex`, `gemini`, `copilot` and `windsurf`. Clients that have a command for adding a server are registered through it; Cursor and Windsurf get an entry added to their JSON server list, with every other entry kept and an unreadable file left untouched. For VS Code, a `code` command that belongs to another editor is not used. The skill is installed only when `claude-code` is among the clients.
